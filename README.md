# Note

This project started a toy project to learn programming in Scala.

Then I realised that it would be fun to implement some algorithms that I know, especially those of machine learning.

# How to 

* Build the source files

   The script "build.sh" is intended to build an individual or all source files all together. The output of the compiling would be generated under the "target" folder.

   e.g.   > ./build.sh naive_bayes.scala

* Run the algorithm

   The script "run.sh" is used to run the compiled program together with the input from the "test" folder.
